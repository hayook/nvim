	    // Key bindings
	    v + navigation: to select
	    d + navigation: to delete
	    [x: int] + navigation: to move x amount
	    [x: int] + u: to undo x times
	    [x: int] + ctl + r: to redo x times 
	    [x: int] + v: to select x words
	    [x: int] + p: to paste x times
	    in general i can bind numbers with any keys to perform actions
	    and bind any key with navigation keys to perform more actions
	    key + iw: to perform actioos on a word (diw: delete word, ciw: change word, yiw: copy word)
	    key + ib|(|): to perform actions on a text inside ()
	    key + i": to perform actions on a text inside ""
	    [x: int] + key + iw/ib/i"...: for more bindings choices
	    t + character: to jump before this character in the same line as the cursor
	    f + character: to jump to this character in the same line as the cursor
	    T/F + character: do the same as t/f but backwards
	    d + t/f + character: to delete till the character
	    %: to move to the closing/opening (/"/{.. (i have the ability to bind this with d/c/p)
	    
	    >>> I have unlimited number of bindings posibilities
 	    
 
	    V		to enter the visual mode and selecting the current line
	    D		to delete the current line when we're in the visual mode and from the current position of the mose to then end of the line when we are in the normal mode
	    dd		to delete the current line in the normal mode
	    x		to delete the current character or the selected text
	    X		to delete the character on the left when we are in the normal mode and the current line when we are in the visual mode 


	    // Copy & Paste only inside Vim (not the clipboard)
	    y		to copy a selected text 
	    Y		to copy the current line (even if it's not selected)
	    p		to paste a text on the right of the cursor 
	    P		to paste a text on the left of the cursor
		deletion is cutting: when you delete something you actually cutting it and you can paste it somewhere

	    // Scrolling
	    ctl + y		to scroll up
	    ctl + e 		to scroll down
	    zz			to put the current line in the midle
	    zt 			to put the current line in the top
	    zb			to put the current line in the bottom
		ctl + d		scroll a bit more down
		ctl + u		scroll a bit more up
	    
		// Indenting
		>>		to move the line one tab to the right
		<<		to move the line one tab to the left
		==		to auto indent blocks inside {} (like autoformat)
		and the same thing here there are many bindings to go with

		// Searching
		/word then press enter to search and find the first result in the file
		?word then press enter to search and find the last result in the file
		n	to go the next occurrence (down for / and up ?)
		N	to go the previous occurrence (up for / and down ?)

		// Marking 
		m + character	to mark with a character
		' + character 	to move to a mark

		// Replacing
		:%s/word/newword/g	to modify the word in the whole file
		:s/word/newword/g	to modify the word in a selected area
			after making this if you want to make to run the last substitution on the whole file there is no need to rewrite the command and add % at the beginning just pres g&

		.		to repeat the last action (the action is stored some where to use it later, dw i deleted a word "....." to delete the next five words)

		// Registers 
		i can read (paste) from and write (copy) to registers in Vim
		regShortCut + copy/paste commands
		registers are stored when closing the instance
		some registers are accessible across other instances of nvim and others not

		// Macros 
		q[MacroName] to start recording a macro 
		do some key bindings (sequence of actions)
		q to stop recoding 
		go the character that you want to start the macro from
		press @[MacroName]
		notes: 
			The MacroName is a single character a, b, c..
			The Macro is just a register
			The macro is accessible acress other nvim instances
			The Macro is stored when closing the instance (because it's a register)

		// One long Line
		One big text is treated as one line in vim, so if i want to deal with it as multiple line i prefix navigation keys with g
		gj/gk/g0/g^/g$/...
		gqq		: to devide one line to multiple lines
		gJ		: join lines without spaces

		// Capitalization
		gu		: to capitalize
		gU		: to uncapitalize
		gUU		: to capitalize the whole line
		guu		: to capitalize the whole line
		~		: switch the capitalization
		g~~		: to work on the whole line
			>> bind these two with anything
